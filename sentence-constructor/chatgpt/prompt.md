    Sentence Structure
    Bears are at the door.

    "Bears" (熊) is the subject.
    "Are" in this case means existence, so we use いる for living things.
    "At the door" indicates location, so it needs a proper particle.
    Did you leave the garbage out?

    "Garbage" (ゴミ) is the object.
    "Leave out" could be expressed with 置く or 出す, depending on the nuance.
    Since it's a question about something done in the past, we need the past tense.
    Hints for the Student
    What particle do we use for location (ドア ___ )?
    What particle do we use for direct objects (ゴミ ___ )?
    How do you conjugate 置く or 出す into past tense?
    How do you form a question in Japanese?
    Give it a try! 😊
